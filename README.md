This repository contains the restuls for the module 9 challenge for Amy Millimen-Tola. This code was created by Amy Millimen-Tola.

Within this file you will find a folder called "data" which contains the csv files that were imported as part of this exercise. There are two sql script files contained in the primary folder, the script used to create the tables which is titled, "module9_createTables".  The second is titled, "moduleChallenge_dataAnalysis" which was created to analyze the data per the exercise instructions.  The 3rd file in this repository is the db diagram, titled "QuickDBD-Module 9 Challenge Diagram".
